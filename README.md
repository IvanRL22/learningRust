# learningRust
Yet another attempt at learning some new thing, this time it's Rust!
# Progress
I will track progress using [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/rust)  
My progress can be seen [here](https://roadmap.sh/rust?s=64ee1aacb128dce3cb8bbbb8)  
# Notes
I will take notes using markdown files using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) locally  
Here is the [vault folder](/RustVault)  
Here is the [main note](/RustVault/Rust.md)  
Note that while Obsidian also uses markdown, it's format is slightly different than Github's  
As such some notes may have weird formatting if seen from Github or an IDE
