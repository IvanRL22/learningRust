There is an important distinction to make between statements and expressions:
- **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value

Function definitions are statements.
Calling a function is an expression.
Calling a macro is an expression.
A scope created with curly brackets is an expression.
